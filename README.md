# SWE-Project
Phase 2 Software Specification:
In Phase 2 of our Software Engineering project, we focused on developing a comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. This phase included defining the project goals and detailing at least 10 functional requirements and 2 non-functional requirements for the system. We created use-case diagrams to illustrate key requirements and designed an overall GUI prototype that aligns with project specifications using tools such as Excalidraw and Canva. Additionally, we produced an initial Software Design Specification (SDS) and set up a GitHub repository configured for scrum, complete with team member details and a detailed README file.
